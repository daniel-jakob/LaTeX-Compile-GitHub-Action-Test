This repo is a test in which I am testing out various features of GitHub which I want to learn about, namely Hooks, Actions, Releases, Wiki and Projects, possibly Docker and Environments.

This is all in an attempt to learn and become deeply familiar with git itself, projects and collaboration.

I want to do this by developing a LaTeX project which has the aim of becoming a comprehensive lecture notes document for any technical college module course, which can be built by the students collaboratively over the course of the semester. This project has the aim of being easy for students to contribute to with a general understanding of LaTeX and GitHub.
