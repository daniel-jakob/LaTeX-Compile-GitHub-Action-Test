\chapter{Radiative Heat Transfer}
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Thermal radiation}
✓ Hot body cools down when placed in an evacuated chamber whose walls are at lower temperature

✓ No conduction and convection inside the cavity - they do not occur in a vacuum

So, what is a mechanism of heat transfer?
What can travel in vacuum?
ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES
Heat transfer is caused by travelling electric and magnetic fields
Thermal radiation can be viewed as:
• Electromagnetic waves (electromagnetic wave theory)
• Massless energy parcels, called photons (quantum
mechanics)
Features of thermal radiation
• It does not need the presence of material medium
• It is the fastest energy transfer mode (speed of light)
• Intensifies at high absolute temperatures
• It is the only energy transfer mode that can take place
between two bodies separated by a medium colder
than both of them.
